Cork on Blender (addon)
=======================

Blender boolean system is getting better every version. However there are serious issues with highly complex meshes.

Thanks to the effort of a dental surgeon, a 3d designer and a software developer, this addon allows the integration of Blender and Cork - a powerful standalone boolean calculations software.

This addon was created in 2015 to help planning and executing [osteotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy)
surgery procedures. Since then it was used in a series of projects involving [orthognathic surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthognathic_surgery) simulations, and human and veterinarian prosthesis modelling.
